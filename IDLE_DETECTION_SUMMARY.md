# 🎯 DDSFocusPro - Updated Idle Detection Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed:
- **Old Threshold**: 180 seconds (3 minutes) - Too sensitive
- **New Threshold**: 600 seconds (10 minutes) - More realistic

## 📊 Impact on User Experience:

### Before (3-minute threshold):
- ❌ False positives when reading documents
- ❌ False positives when thinking/planning
- ❌ Interruptions during short breaks
- ❌ "Auto-paused due to 181 seconds system idle" messages

### After (10-minute threshold):
- ✅ No interruption during normal work pauses
- ✅ Allows time for reading and thinking
- ✅ Reasonable break tolerance
- ✅ Only triggers on genuine extended breaks

## 🔍 When Idle Detection Triggers:

### Will NOT trigger (No auto-pause):
- Reading emails/documents (2-8 minutes)
- Thinking and planning (1-5 minutes)
- Quick bathroom breaks (3-7 minutes)
- Coffee breaks (5-8 minutes)
- Phone calls while looking at screen (varies)

### WILL trigger (Auto-pause):
- Extended lunch breaks (15+ minutes)
- Meeting breaks (12+ minutes)
- Personal calls away from desk (15+ minutes)
- Genuine work interruptions (10+ minutes)

## 🛠️ Technical Details:

### Files Updated:
1. `moduller/system_idle_detector.py` - Backend idle detection
2. `static/script/client.js` - Frontend idle handling
3. `app.py` - Idle time subtraction logic

### Configuration:
```python
IDLE_THRESHOLD = 600  # seconds (10 minutes)
IDLE_THRESHOLD_SECONDS = 600  # seconds (10 minutes)
const totalIdleSeconds = 600;  // 10 minutes
```

## 🎊 Result:
Users will experience fewer interruptions and more natural work flow, 
with idle detection only triggering on genuinely long breaks.
